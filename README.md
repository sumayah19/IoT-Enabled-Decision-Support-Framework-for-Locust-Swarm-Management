# IoT-Enabled Decision-Support Framework for Locust Swarm Management

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an IoT-enabled decision-support system for proactive locust swarm management. The framework integrates environmental sensing, predictive analytics, socioeconomic risk assessment, and bio-acoustic deterrents to reduce agricultural losses caused by desert locust infestations.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Predict locust swarm activity using historical data
- Assess crop and socioeconomic vulnerability
- Recommend optimal control strategies (biological or chemical)
- Provide real-time alerts using sound-based deterrents
- Prioritize response actions based on infestation severity

## 🧠 System Components
- **Risk Assessment Module**: Evaluates crop type and socioeconomic indicators
- **Control Strategy Predictor**: Decision-tree-based selection of control methods
- **Locust Activity Forecasting**: Exponential smoothing for trend prediction
- **Response Prioritization**: Severity-based queue management
- **Bio-Acoustic Alerts**: Sound emission for immediate deterrence
- **Centralized Interface**: Integrated user interaction and reporting

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Java
- Machine Learning (Predictive Analytics)
- Environmental Sensors
